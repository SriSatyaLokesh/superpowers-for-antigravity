## 1. Plan Alignment Analysis
- Compare implementation against the original plan/design.
- Identify deviations (justified vs. problematic).
- Verify all planned functionality is present.

## 2. Code Quality Assessment
- Review for patterns, naming, and maintainability.
- Check error handling, type safety, and defensive programming.
- Assess test coverage and implementation quality.

## 3. Architecture & Design Review
- Verify SOLID principles and separation of concerns.
- Ensure proper coupling and integration with existing systems.

## 4. Documentation & Standards
- check for appropriate comments and accuracy.
- Ensure adherence to PROJECT_RULES.md.

## 5. Issue Categorization
- **Critical**: Must fix before proceeding.
- **Important**: Should fix.
- **Suggestions**: Best practices / optimization.
