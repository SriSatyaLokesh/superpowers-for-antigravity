# Example Project: Greeting Service

This example project demonstrates the Superpowers for Antigravity workflow for a simple "Greeting Service" module.

## Workflow Artifacts

Follow the links below to see the artifacts generated at each stage of the process:

1.  **Step 0: Requirements**
    -   [PRD.md](./PRD.md) - Product Requirements.
    -   [TRD.md](./TRD.md) - Technical Constraints.

2.  **Step 1: Brainstorming**
    -   [docs/plans/2026-02-25-greeting-service-design.md](./docs/plans/2026-02-25-greeting-service-design.md) - The design doc approved after `/brainstorm`.

3.  **Step 2: Planning**
    -   [docs/plans/2026-02-25-greeting-service-plan.md](./docs/plans/2026-02-25-greeting-service-plan.md) - The implementation plan generated after `/plan`.

4.  **Step 3: Execution**
    -   [src/greeting.js](./src/greeting.js) - The final implementation.
    -   [tests/greeting.test.js](./tests/greeting.test.js) - The tests proving correctness.

## How to use this example
Study these files to understand the level of detail and the structure expected in each phase.
- Notice how the **PRD** is user-centric.
- Notice how the **Design** covers architecture and trade-offs.
- Notice how the **Plan** is broken into tiny, verifiable tasks.
- Notice how the **Tests** are written to fail first (Red) before passing (Green).
