# Superpowers for Antigravity — Release Notes

## v1.0.0 (2026-02-25)

This is the official initial release of **Superpowers for Antigravity**. 

This project was forged by taking a snapshot of the professional **Superpowers** ecosystem (v4.3.1) and refactoring it into a lean, Antigravity-native **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)**. 

### 🚀 The Evolution

We transitioned from a monolithic plugin supporting multiple platforms (Claude, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode) to a specialized, high-performance integration designed exclusively for Google Antigravity and Gemini models.

### ✨ Key Deliverables in v1.0.0

- **Antigravity-Native Structure**: Full migration to `.agent/skills` and `.agent/workflows`.
- **Gemini Optimization**: Native support for Gemini Pro and Flash via bespoke instruction sets.
- **Synthesized Skills Library**:
    - **Context Engineering**: Integrated high-performance skills from GSD-for-Antigravity.
    - **Technical Excellence**: Integrated official Anthropic technical skills (Webapp testing, MCP builder, etc.).
- **Canonical Process Rules**: Established `PROJECT_RULES.md` and `SUPERPOWER-STYLE.md` as the unified constitution for the workflow.
- **Mission Control**: Robust slash command support for `/brainstorm`, `/plan`, `/execute`, `/debug`, `/review`, and `/help`.

### 🤝 Origins & Credits

While this repository marks a new beginning for the Antigravity platform, it stands on the shoulders of:

1.  **[Original Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** (v4.3.1): The source of our core skill philosophy.
2.  **[GSD for Antigravity](https://github.com/toonight/get-shit-done-for-antigravity)**: The architectural template for our Antigravity-native structure.
